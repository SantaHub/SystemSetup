# VS Code Extensions 

Vs code extensions that I use.

1. [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker):
    - Auto complete and suggestions for dockerfile.
    - Intial research shows telemetry data being taken and can be turned off.
2. [Github Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
    - Improving adding comments and provide code skeletons.
    - Use Paid plan to avoid data extraction.
3. [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens):
    - Takes project structures, exploring the pricing plans does not reveal a way out of it. Need to spend more time.
